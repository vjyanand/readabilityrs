//! Article data structure representing the parsed output.
//!
//! This module defines the [`Article`] struct, which contains all extracted content
//! and metadata from a successfully parsed web page.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use readabilityrs::{Readability, ReadabilityOptions};
//!
//! let html = r#"<html><body><article><h1>My Article</h1><p>Content...</p></article></body></html>"#;
//! let readability = Readability::new(html, Some("https://example.com"), None).unwrap();
//!
//! if let Some(article) = readability.parse() {
//!     // Access article fields
//!     println!("Title: {:?}", article.title);
//!     println!("Length: {} characters", article.length);
//!     println!("Author: {:?}", article.byline);
//!
//!     // Get cleaned HTML content
//!     if let Some(content) = article.content {
//!         println!("HTML: {}", content);
//!     }
//!
//!     // Or get plain text
//!     if let Some(text) = article.text_content {
//!         println!("Text: {}", text);
//!     }
//! }
//! ```

/// Represents a successfully parsed article with extracted content and metadata.
///
/// The `Article` struct contains all the extracted information from a web page,
/// including the main content (both HTML and plain text), metadata (title, author,
/// publish date), and other article properties.
///
/// ## Fields
///
/// All fields are optional (`Option<String>`) because not all web pages contain
/// all metadata fields. The `length` field is always present and represents the
/// character count of the extracted text.
///
/// ## Serialization
///
/// This struct implements `Serialize` and `Deserialize` from serde, making it
/// easy to save articles to JSON or other formats:
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// use readabilityrs::{Readability, Article};
/// # let html = "<html></html>";
/// # let readability = Readability::new(html, None, None).unwrap();
///
/// if let Some(article) = readability.parse() {
///     let json = serde_json::to_string_pretty(&article).unwrap();
///     println!("{}", json);
/// }
/// ```

    ///
    /// The title is extracted by checking multiple sources in priority order: JSON-LD structured
    /// data is checked first, followed by OpenGraph and Twitter Card meta tags. If neither is
    /// available, the `<title>` tag is used after cleaning it of the site name. As a final
    /// fallback, the first `<h1>` tag in the document is used.
    pub title: Option<String>,

    /// - Empty elements cleaned up
